I am a fifth-year Electrical Engineering student at Georgia Tech interested in working for TechJect this summer. I have a growing interest in aviation, which has recently directed me towards UAVs. I have ideas about making wireless mesh networks supported by routers attached to drones, as well less practical dreams of a pet quadcopter to follow me around. Unfortunately I haven't had an opportunity to work directly with UAVs, nor have I had the opportunity to work hands-on with hardware in a real work environment as much of my past experience has been in software, and I see TechJect as a great chance to do both. I also have a growing interest in entrepreneurship, and working at an ATDC company seems like a great way to get more involved in the Atlanta startup community. 

I have solid classroom experience with FPGAs and VHDL, but more importantly a decent amount experience with ATmega processors though personal projects, many of which are on my blog. My recent software projects have mostly focused on scripting languages and web development, but I have a solid background in C, both from working with microprocessors and from working primarily in Linux for around five years now. Most of my software projects from the last two years are on GitHub.

I feel that my interests and experience make me a good fit for your company. Please reach out to me if you have any questions, and thank you for considering me for your position.

Sincerely,

Julian
